# cross-device-copy-paste

## Motivation:

A small SPA project for myself to be able to send website links, code snippets, and/ or files, across different devices, without having to use emails, bluetooth transfers, or typing search terms out again.
(Also a project for practicing TypeScript)


Built with: MongoDB, Express, React(TS), NodeJS; as well as Vite/react-router-dom

<!-- For example, I cannot run Docker on my laptop, but I can on my PC. However all my bookmarks, development environments and browsing experience is fully set up on my laptop. Therefore, I might want to look up and type out code snippets on my laptop, but actually them on my PC. -->
